**TO DO**

- Correctly assign the "active-post" class to the active post so it gets the correct css
- ~~Show posts on blog tab from newest to oldest (currently its oldest to newest)~~
- Add vanity URLs to blog posts
- Decide on a css for the active post, since the one I have right now is not viable to use on different screen sizes
- Format the admin pages somewhat decently
- Add the correct partial to display error messages to admin pages
- Add checks for error messages display on tests
- Add account activation and password forget to users
- Add image uploading (given heroku's conditions, it might be best to use S3 from the start)
- Related to ^, add SendGrid for mails, postgres for DB and whatever other production env changes are necessary to pass to production
