<p>We have received a request to reset your password. In case you requested this, this is the link for you to do so:</p>

<%= link_to "Reset password", edit_admin_password_reset_url(@user.reset_token, email: @user.email) %>

<p>This link will expire in two hours.</p>

<p>If you did not request to reset your password, simply ignore this email and no changes will be made.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
