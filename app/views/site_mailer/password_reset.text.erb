<%= @greeting %> <%= @user.name %>,

We have received a request to reset your password. In case you requested this, this is the link for you to do so:

<%= edit_admin_password_reset_url(@user.reset_token, email: @user.email) %>

This link will expire in two hours.

If you did not request to reset your password, simply ignore this email and no changes will be made.

Regards,
